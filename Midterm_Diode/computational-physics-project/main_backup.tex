\section{Abstract}
\paragraph{}
The semiconductor device is where electrical engineering meets quantum physics. By understanding the crystalline lattice structure of molecules and how charge carriers move through them, the ability to manipulate them was derived. 'Doping', the deliberate process of adding impurities into a structure, is the base theory behind the modern semiconductor. By placing two (differently) doped structures next to one another, a junction is created; this meeting of doped crystalline structures is the science behind all modern day electronics, including transistors and integrated circuits. Our experiment will seek to simulate with 3D visualizations based on C code the most basic of the semiconductor structures, the diode; a device that, when doped, only allows current to flow unidirectionally; this paper is the documentation of that experiment.

\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
To work through this problem we first needed to understand, in depth, the inner workings of the diode and how electricity moves through it, and why. This process was made relatively easy, since all group members have a background in electrical engineering. The trick was in figuring out how to take our knowledge of the physical chemistry of a diode, the understanding of its electrical properties, and translate that into a computer simulation. 
	The diode simulation takes the form of a plane with various fields placed along its length. For easy visualization, the different fields are denoted by lines that stretch across the plane. When the program runs with a voltage source applied in the 'proper' orientation, current will flow across the diode. However, as would happen in reality, if the voltage source is 'backwards' (or, in effect, the diode turned the other direction), current flow stops. \\
    
   

\section{Theory}
\paragraph{}
Semiconductors are unique in the electrical world in that they are able to both conduct and repel electric current. They are made of material that has an electrical conductivity between strong electric conductors, such as gold or copper, and insulators, such as rubber or plastic. The most commonly used element for semiconductor devices is silicon, a metalloid in the periodic table. Pure silicon has no free electrons, which is why the element is doped to give it enhanced electro-conductive properties. The doping process includes introducing impurities into the silicone crystal, as can be seen in Figure 1.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{doping.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig} Diagram of doping process}
\end{figure}

As noted in the figure above, N-type doping adds an impurity to the silicone structure that introduces free electrons, while P-type introduces vacant positions, or 'holes', for free electrons to fill. 

A diode is the physical object that puts this doping into practice at its most basic level. At the junction where P-type and N-type meet is where things get interesting. The extra electrons from the N-type transition over to the P-side, which gives the P-side a slightly negative charge. Simultaneously, since the electrons have moved out of the N-type region, that area gets a slightly positive charge. The electric field that results from this is known as the depletion region, which can be seen below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Diodes2.PNG}\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Depletion.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig} Physical diode and representations (left), Depletion region (right)}
\end{figure}

The depletion region is the basis of the barrier that stops electron flow. Applying current to the diode "backwards" results in what is known as reverse biasing, in which the depletion zone widens as power source attracts both electrons and holes. However, when connected the other way, and if an electron has enough energy, it can overcome the barrier potential and cross the depletion region. Negative electrons are pushed away by negative terminal, and "fall into the holes", depleted of energy. The electrons behind it cross the barrier and occupy the next line of holes, and so on, until the holes are full, and electricity passes through the diode. This result is the one-way flow of electricity. 

In an ideal world with perfect conditions, the graph of Voltage vs Current (V vs I) should be zero at all points from negative infinity to 0V, then instantaneously spike along the y-axis at V>=0. In effect, the diode would be treated as nothing but a wire. In reality there are physical limitations on the chemical structure of silicone, which is why we need to reach a certain voltage potential before the barrier potential can be crossed. For silicone diodes, this happens at right around 0.7V. In the other direction, if a strong enough negative voltage is applied to the diode, it will eventually overpower the depletion zone and current will flow. This phenomena is known as 'breakdown', but only happens at voltages stronger than -50V, and will not be simulated in our experiment. The voltage vs current graphs of ideal vs real diodes is shown below.

\section{Simulation Design}
\paragraph{}

The general characteristics the Diode simulation is trying to model are the ability of diodes to allow current flow in one direction, the non linear relation of diode voltage and diode current, reverse bias current breakdown(i.e. exposed to a large voltage, the diode will allow reverse current), and the effect of changing the forward and reverse gap voltages. To create these behaviors, a voltage source, diode, and a resistance are needed. 

The existing simulation(MDTherm.c) from PHYS370 has most of the dynamics necessary to simulate a diode. By adding charges to the particles, they can behave similar to electrons in a circuit. To simulate the voltage source, an area in the simulation box with a vertical, horizontal, length, and width is defined. If a particle is in this "voltage" box, a force in the vertical direction is applied to move the particles and simulate electrical current. The diode is composed of 2 of these force fields(forward gap and reverse gap) that are similar to the voltage source, but the forward gap only acts on particles moving with positive vertical velocity, and the downward gap acts on those with negative vertical velocity.

\subsection{Theory-Mathematics}

We need to be able to set voltages using force. Using the equations below a relation between force and voltage can be derived.

Where E ~ Electric Field, V ~ Voltage, Q ~ particle charge, dl ~ Field Length

$ V = \vec{E}*dl $ 
$ \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{N}}{Q} $

Derived relation between Voltage and Force:

$ \vec{N} = \frac{V*Q}{dl}$

Similarly this can done for resistance:

\subsubsection{Requirements}

Inputs
\begin{enumerate}
\item Voltage Source (Voltage)
\item Particle Charge
\item Forward Diode Gap (Voltage)
\item Reverse Diode Gap (Voltage)
\item Voltage Sweep ~ v start, v end, increment voltage, averaging time
\end{enumerate}

Outputs
\begin{enumerate}
\item .dat file with the VI Curve for analysis
\item Real time current graph
\item graphics lines on the simulation to notate circuit components
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Code Explained}
\paragraph{Subroutines}

This subroutine calculates the average current by summing the voltages, dividing by box length (L) and multiplying by particle charge.

\begin{minted}{c}
// functions defined for midterm
double getCurrent(double v[N][D]){
	double sumV = 0;
	for(int n = 0;n<N;n++){
		sumV += v[n][1];
		}
	return iq*sumV/L;
}
\end{minted}

This subroutine calculates the forces for the different components based on the input voltages, resistances. It also sets the charge of the particles. This makes it easier to change parameters quickly while simulating

\begin{minted}{c}
void setVoltageSource(){
  //calculate forces for the given voltages
  v_f = iq*vs_v/volt_len;		//calculate the field from the set voltage
  ud_f = iq*ud_v/diode_len_p;		//calculate the field from the set upper diode voltage gap
  dd_f = iq*dd_v/diode_len_n;		//calculate the field from the lower diode votlage gap
  for (int n=0; n<N; n++){
    for (int d=0; d<D; d++){
    q[n] = iq;				//set initial charge for each electron
    }}

}
\end{minted}

This routine sweeps the voltage from start to end with an increment, outputs a file with the voltage and current information to look at diode VI characteristics.

\begin{minted}{c}
void VI_Curve(){
  FILE *res;
  char IsoName[100];
  double sumI = 0;

  sprintf(IsoName,"VI_Curve_Q_%f_N_%i_ud_v_%f_dd_v_%f.dat",iq,N,ud_v,dd_v);//put info in the filename to distinguish test params
  res=fopen(IsoName,"w");
  //sweep the voltage
  if(v_incr < 0 ){
	  for (double ivolt = v_start;ivolt>v_end;ivolt = ivolt + v_incr){
		//set the voltage
		vs_v = ivolt;
		setVoltageSource();
		//loop to waste some time to get the current to settle
		for(int t = 0;t<v_sweep_delta;t++)
			{
			iterate(x,v,dt);
	       	 	Events(1);
			DrawGraphs();
			sumI += current_var;
			}
		//save the current and voltage data
		fprintf(res,"%e %f\n",sumI/v_sweep_delta,vs_v);
	   }
   }
     else{
	  for (double ivolt = v_start;ivolt<v_end;ivolt = ivolt + v_incr){
		//set the voltage
		vs_v = ivolt;
		setVoltageSource();
		//loop to waste some time to get the current to settle
		for(int t = 0;t<v_sweep_delta;t++)
			{
			iterate(x,v,dt);
	       	 	Events(1);
			DrawGraphs();
			sumI += current_var;
			}
		//save the current and voltage data
		fprintf(res,"%e %f\n",sumI/v_sweep_delta,vs_v);
	   }
   }

  fclose(res);
}

\end{minted}

Code added to draw() subroutine to draw lines where the voltage source, diode, and resistor fields exist.

\begin{minted}{c}

//voltage source lines
  mydrawline(2,0,scalefac*(L-volt_pos+volt_len/2),size,scalefac*(L-volt_pos+volt_len/2));
  mydrawline(2,0,scalefac*(L-volt_pos-volt_len/2),size,scalefac*(L-volt_pos-volt_len/2));

//diode field 1 lines
  mydrawline(3,0,scalefac*(L-diode_pos_p + diode_len_p/2),size,scalefac*(L-diode_pos_p + diode_len_p/2));
  mydrawline(3,0,scalefac*(L-diode_pos_p - diode_len_p/2),size,scalefac*(L-diode_pos_p - diode_len_p/2));

//diode field 2 lines
 // mydrawline(4,0,100,size,100);
  mydrawline(4,0,scalefac*(L-diode_pos_n - diode_len_n/2),size,scalefac*(L-diode_pos_n - diode_len_n/2));

//resistor field lines
  mydrawline(6,0,scalefac*(L-res_pos+res_len/2),size,scalefac*(L-res_pos+res_len/2));
  mydrawline(6,0,scalefac*(L-res_pos-res_len/2),size,scalefac*(L-res_pos-res_len/2));

\end{minted}

\paragraph{Code added to iterate routine}

This code iterates through each particle and determines a force to apply to each particle depending on their position and velocity. This simulates the voltage source, diode, and a resistor(the resistor is untested).

\begin{minted}{c}
    for (int n=0;n<N;n++)
      for (int d=0;d<D;d++){
	//begin conditions for diode, resistor, and voltage source regions
	v[n][d]+=(ff[n][d])/mass[n]*dt;// integrate to get velocity
	
	if (d == 1){// if the dimension is in the Y dimension... vertical
	//check to see if the particle is in diode p, diode n, voltage, resistor regions, then apply the appropriate force
		if ((x[n][d] < (diode_pos_p+diode_len_p/2)) && (x[n][d] > (diode_pos_p-diode_len_p/2))&& v[n][d] < 0){//upward diode field.. if the particle has -v then force particle upwards
			field_force = ud_f - current_var;//simulate the forward diode band gap
			}
		else if((x[n][d] < (diode_pos_n+diode_len_n/2)) && (x[n][d] > (diode_pos_n-diode_len_n/2))&& (v[n][d] > 0)){//downward diode field... stops reverse bias current throgh the diode
			field_force = dd_f + current_var;//simulate the reverse diode band gap
			}
		else if((x[n][d] < (volt_pos + volt_len/2)) && (x[n][d] > (volt_pos - volt_len/2))){//voltage source field... provides electromotive force to propel particles throgh diode
			field_force = v_f;//simualate voltage source
			}
		else if((x[n][d] > (res_pos - res_len/2)) && (x[n][d] < (res_pos + res_len/2)) && abs(v[n][d]) > 0){//resistor field... just a resistor for fun
			field_force = -v[n][d]*q[n]*q[n]*resistance/(res_len*res_len);// derived from V=IR, V=E*dl, E=N/C
			}
		else{
			field_force = 0;	//particle is not in a component, then no force.	
		}
	v[n][d]+=(field_force)/mass[n]*dt;//integrate again to update velocity with the accelerations of the fields
	
	}
	else{
		field_force = 0;		
		}

	}
\end{minted}



\paragraph{Code added for graphing data}

Observing how current changes when different inputs changed was important to verify that the program was functioning properly.

Storing current data
\begin{minted}{c}
  //storing current values for graphing later
  memmove(&IImeas[1],&IImeas[0],(MeasMax-1)*sizeof(double));
  IImeas[0]=current_var;
\end{minted}

Plotting current data with respect to time
\begin{minted}{c}
DefineGraphN_R("Average Current",&IImeas[0],&Measlen,NULL);
\end{minted}

The contour plot is the Integer Lattice Gas Simulation with an independent moving wall. This is the simulation with the wall velocity being nonzero(0.5) and positive.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces  This is a simulation where the dynamic wall's horizontal velocity is proportional to the momentum gained by the gas particles divided by a set mass. The left hand side has particle densities of 100 from x = 0 to 40 and then densities of 20 from 60 to 100. The purpose of this experiment was to watch the wall velocity change based on particle collisions. See how the velocity (vx0 is equal to \nobreakspace  {}0.1)}}{4}}
